# **Mind and Machine: Brain Regions and AI Concepts**

## **Project Overview**

The **Mind and Machine** project aimed to create an **interactive visualization** comparing **brain regions** to their corresponding **AI/ML concepts**. The goal was to illustrate how different parts of the human brain, such as the **Amygdala** and **Hippocampus**, are functionally similar to AI systems, like **Emotion Recognition** and **Memory Networks**. This comparison was meant to highlight the **intersection between neuroscience** and **artificial intelligence** by visualizing the biological and co...

### **Original Concept**:

- **Brain Region to AI Comparison**: 
  The project began with the intention of creating a **network map** where each **brain region** would be linked to an **AI/ML concept** (e.g., the **Amygdala** to **Emotion Recognition AI**, **Frontal Lobe** to **Decision-Making AI**).
  
- **Interactive Visualization**:
  The visualization was intended to be **interactive**, allowing the user to click on a brain region to learn about its functions, compare it to its AI counterpart, and explore detailed visual content for each region and its AI analogy.

- **Hosted Visuals**:
  The project was meant to include **generated images** (diagrams showing the brain region, its process, and the AI counterpart) that would **appear** when a region node was clicked. These visuals would explain both the **biological** and **AI/ML processes**.

## **Challenges Faced**

### **Flourish Limitations**:

Initially, **Flourish** was selected for creating the **interactive network map**. However, despite Flourish’s excellent visualization capabilities, it **did not support external image hosting**, and there was no way to directly **upload images** into the visualization. This severely limited the project’s ability to display the **region-based diagrams** and **AI comparisons** as initially envisioned.

### **Think Machine Limitations**:

Next, I attempted to use **Think Machine** to create a **network layout** similar to what was planned. Unfortunately, **Think Machine** also lacked the ability to **save** or **add images** directly, which hindered the ability to visually display the **brain region and AI concepts** side-by-side.

### **Jupyter Notebook Attempt**:

I also explored using **Jupyter Notebook** to generate the necessary **HTML/CSS/JS files** for the website. While I was able to create a basic layout, the **interactive elements** and **dynamic content** weren’t working as expected. Despite efforts to integrate everything into one seamless notebook, the solution fell short due to compatibility issues with generating the final **website-ready content**.

## **What the Project Ended Up Being**

After encountering challenges with the initial tools and approaches, the project evolved into a **simplified interactive visualization** hosted on **Flourish**. The final version showcases:

- **Brain Regions and AI Comparisons**: 
  The interactive visualization now features a **network map** that links each brain region to its corresponding **AI/ML concept** (e.g., **Amygdala → Emotion Recognition AI**, **Frontal Lobe → Decision-Making AI**).
  
- **Interactive User Experience**: 
  Clicking on each brain region node **displays tooltips** with descriptions, and users can **explore the functions** of both the brain regions and their AI counterparts.
  
- **Images and Descriptions**: 
  Despite earlier limitations, the project includes **linked images** for **AI/ML concepts**, provided via **TinyPic hosting**. The goal was to represent the **concepts visually**, even if it required adapting the project’s structure to accommodate external image hosting.

## **Technologies Used**:

- **Flourish**: For the interactive visualization and network map.
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: To structure and style the website and its content.
- **TinyPic**: To host images of AI/ML concepts for use in the visualization.

## **Lessons Learned**

This project showed that while **Flourish** and **Think Machine** offer powerful tools for visualizing data, there are **limitations** to consider when trying to incorporate **custom images** and **external content**. Despite these setbacks, the project successfully demonstrated the **intersection of neuroscience and AI** through interactive and informative visualizations. The **lesson learned** is that when working with tools that have specific limitations, **adaptation** and **finding creative workarounds** are key to achieving a functional and informative result.
